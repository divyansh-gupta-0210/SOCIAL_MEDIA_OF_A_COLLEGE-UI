# SOCIAL MEDIA Of A College UI

This app has the UI, that every college should have to show to there students.
It has 3 tabs at the TOP. And each tab signifes the working of a college's student life. Froms the details of the clubs to the details of every event done by the clubs of the college.
Every aspect is mentioned clearly below.


## Events

Every college has hundreds of clubs and all those clubs organise many events. So in order to track each and every event and, have a good publicity and a reach. 
This tab has it!
For students it is like tinder swipe cards, 
If a person likes the event he would swipe it right, and a new page stating about the event event will show up.
Similarly if the student doesn't like the event he would left swipe it and and next event would appear as a card.
